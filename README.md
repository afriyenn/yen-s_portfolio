# 📊 Project 1: Sales Performance & Channel Analysis Dashboard

## 1.1 Project Background

Tripio is a mid-sized transportation booking platform operating across multiple regions in Indonesia. Between 2022 and 2024, the company experienced steady growth driven by online channels. In mid-2024, Tripio expanded its offline acquisition efforts through a field activation program at major transportation hubs, aiming to accelerate app adoption and ticket sales. While this initiative successfully increased transaction volume, management began questioning whether the growth translated into sustainable revenue performance.This project was initiated to evaluate overall sales performance, assess the impact of different sales channels, and identify whether increased volume reflected healthy business growth.

**BIG BUSINESS QUESTION:** Is Tripio’s recent sales growth driven by healthy customer value, or by low-quality volume from offline activation?

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on Revenue, Ticket Sold, and Average Ticket Price.
- **Product Level Performance:** An analysis of Tripio's various transport operators, understanding their impact on sales and returns.
- **Channel Performance:** Measure the growth of sales coming from Apps to drive digital transformation and apps downloads.
- **Regional Comparison:** An evaluation of sales and ticket sold by region.

## 1.2 Data Structure & Initial Checks

**a. Data Overview**
- Orders (transaction-level)
- Customers
- Routes / Products (AKDP vs long-distance)
- Channels (Online, Field Activation)
- Regions
- Dates

**b. Data Overview**
- Spike validation post-activation
- AOV consistency across channels
- Route distance vs. revenue distribution
- Channel misclassiffication (offline orders recorded as online)

## 1.3 Executive Summary

### a. Overview of Findings

Despite strong growth in ticket volume following the expansion of field activation programs, Tripio’s overall revenue growth remained muted. Analysis shows that offline-acquired transactions were heavily skewed toward short-distance routes with significantly lower average order value. While online channels continued to generate fewer transactions, they contributed disproportionately higher revenue per ticket. This indicates that recent growth was driven more by volume expansion than by sustainable revenue quality.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
